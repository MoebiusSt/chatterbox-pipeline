A dream come true.
Experiences of a Ukrainian bandurist at the Global Music Workshop in Boston.
A text by Anastasiya Voytyuk.

It was a night in March 2023. I was sitting and filling in a lot of documents for a group of Ukrainian musicians to travel to Great Britain in relation to the UK/UA Season of Culture, when I received a message from a good friend of mine, a bandura player from North America, Julian Kytasty. It was a link to a competition to participate in Silkroad’s Global Music Workshop (GMW), an annual summer program for musicians who experiment with a combination of different styles of music, including folk, which is exactly what I am looking out for and what is so hard to find in Ukraine.
