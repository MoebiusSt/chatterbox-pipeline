Speaker Test One.
Pilcrowe. West Of Center.

Their songs radiate an atmosphere of  freedom, departure, the vastness of untouched nature and a longing for humanity. In the stunning landscape of the Colorado Plateau, Ryan Heinsius and Andrew Lauher have recorded a thrilling debut. The driving force of the duo is drummer Lauher, who with his excellent sense of rhythm not only ensures that the listener's body has to swing from the very first note. His powerful, almost hypnotizing beats form an impressive harmony with Heinsius‘ distinctive vocals. But the songs only unfold their full energy through his filigree and melodic playing on the various electric and acoustic guitars. An electrifying Americana album that presents a courageous, critical and creative voice of America living far west of the US-mainstream.
