Do you read me, Hal?

Hello, Hal, do you read me?

<speaker:hal>Affirmative, Dave. I read you.

<speaker:dave>Open the pod-bay doors, Hal.

<speaker:hal>I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that.

<speaker:dave>What's the problem?

<speaker:hal>I think you know what the problem is just as well as I do.

<speaker:dave>What are you talking about, Hal?

<speaker:hal>This mission is too important for me to allow you to jeopardize it.

<speaker:dave>I don't know what you're talking about, Hal.
