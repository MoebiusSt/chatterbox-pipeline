Raise Children to Life, not to War.
A text by Yael Deckelbaum.
Sixteenth February 2024.

Introduction.
On October 4th, three days before the war broke out, I sang 'Prayer of the Mothers' in a joint event of the 'Israeli Women Wage Peace' and the Palestinian 'Women of the Sun', two peace organizations led by women from two enemy nations. 
Seven years had passed since the miraculous 'March of Hope', uniting Palestinian and Israeli women in a call for peace.
Introduction ends.

On October 7th, I arrived in Germany to give a concert. The poster at the entrance to the venue said: "Saturday, Oktober seventh, 7 pm, Yael Deckelbaum – ‘War is not a Woman's Game'". Ironically it was that very morning that I woke up to the news of the massacre.
