Published online on January the 12th, 2024.

Their songs radiate an atmosphere of freedom, departure, the vastness of untouched nature and a longing for humanity. In the stunning landscape of the Colorado Plateau, Ryan Heinsius and Andrew Lauher have recorded a thrilling debut. Based in Flagstaff, Arizona, they present nine up-tempo songs that are not only musically influenced by the immense geographic beauty outside the major U.S. metropolitan cities as well as Washington.
