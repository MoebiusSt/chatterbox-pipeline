At the Celtic Connections festival in Glasgow the band made contacts for their first tour of Germany which took place in September 2022. A review of one of those concerts can be found, here. When Joe Gibney – trademark, hand cupped behind his left ear while singing, steps forward to the microphone, closing your eyes, you might believe for a short moment you had Luke Kelly and the Dubliners in front of you. 

This little journey in time ends abruptly when the instruments get going, clearly leaving the last century behind, weaving multiple threads of melodies in a virtuoso manner. With his powerful voice, straightforward and full of emotion, Gibney interprets his own songs and the works of others such as Dave Sudbury’s "The King Of Rome" with the same intenseness. Check out the video link below! James Ryan, quietly standing at the side, keeps the threads together with his guitar grooves while flute and fiddle whirl about pushing each other onwards.
