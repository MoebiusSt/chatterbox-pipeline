That’s why we will win.
The situation of artists in Ukraine in the face of russian aggression.

[Introduction]

In the middle of December, a colleague from Poland called me and offered me the opportunity to play a concert on February 24, 2023, to commemorate the anniversary of Ukraine’s resistance to the Russian attack. At that moment, I began to realize that this terrible war, which actually began nine years ago, had already then been going on for almost a year.

Since April 2022, like many Ukrainian musicians, I am actively performing mainly in Poland and abroad. These are opportunities to raise funds to help Ukraine and to work. They are a good way to communicate with the world. After a whole year, the news about the war in Ukraine often have kind of faded into the background. On the one hand, this is natural, because people cannot constantly be in a state of turmoil and hear only about the war. But on the other, the war is still going on, and in order to win, we must not forget about it. An observation that makes us musicians realize and shape our values: We understand that we should be voices for Ukraine and an anti-russian, anti-imperialist message in the world.

In addition to the fact that the musical community of Ukraine first of all consists of just normal people with emotions, fears and hopes, we feel that there is an important role we play in the war: It is to observe, experience, record, tell and also to give hope, share necessary and important emotions in times of war with the people in Ukraine but also abroad. That was my actual motivation when, in mid-April 2022, I agreed to leave volunteering at a shelter for displaced people in Lviv and go on a charity tour of Polish cities with my own band Troye Zillia together with DagaDana. I very clearly felt the connection between victory and the development of culture – in the case of Ukraine, these are closely related things.
